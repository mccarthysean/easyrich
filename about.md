Hi, I'm Sean McCarthy and I'm Chief Data Scientist at [IJACK Technologies Inc](https://myijack.com). I'm from Moosomin, Saskatchewan, Canada, and I now live in Calgary, Alberta, Canada with my wife Simina Ionescu-Mocanu, and two boys Jack and Shea. 

I have another site with courses and blog posts about machine learning, programming, and web development at [mccarthysean.dev](https://mccarthysean.dev).

## Purpose of this Site

I created this site to share information with my friends and family, and anyone else who's interested in learning how to get rich the easy way. It's my way of giving back. I want nothing in return, but I'd love to read your comments, feedback, and stories. 

Over the years, in talking with regular folks, I've heard a lot of conflicting, confusing, and misleading thoughts and ideas on how to get rich. Lately, the one I've heard the most when I mention "investing" to someone new, is, "are you talking about Bitcoin?"... Gosh, I've heard that far too often lately. No, I'm absolutely not talking about Bitcoin. 

I've also heard lots of negative thoughts about how the game is rigged against ordinary people. I can assure you it's not. I hope to share how simple it is to save some money, invest it (i.e. buy yourself some companies to generate some passive earnings), and watch it grow. Anyone can open a brokerage account and buy any companies they want. Keep buying, and with a little patience and discipline, one day you'll be rich too.
